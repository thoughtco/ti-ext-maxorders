## Maximum Orders per timeslot

This extension allows you to set a maximum number of orders that can be accepted at different timeslots, as well as allowing limitations by location, day the week, order type, and menu item category.

This is free and doesn't require a license, but you can [donate to Ryan](https://github.com/sponsors/ryanmitchell), the developer behind it, to show your appreciation.
